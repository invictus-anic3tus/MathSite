# IF YOU'RE FROM HIGH SEAS:
Hi! Glad you're here. Please visit all the pages on the demo, reading stuff and whatnot. I put a lot of effort into each page, especially the AMAZING FUNCTIONAL CALCULATOR!!!!! Also, the contact thingy DOES SEND ME emails, so don't spam please!

# What is MathSite?
If you're a student, have you ever been pouring over mathbooks, textbooks, websites, and notes trying to find the formula you need?
No more! Welcome to MathSite, where everything you need is right here. On the definitions page, read up on all the terms and rules you need.
At the formulas page, you can remember things like the volume of a cone, or maybe learn some for the first time!
Next, at the calculator page, use the simple but powerful calculator and notepad for complicated problems, complete with a pi variable, and sine, cosine, and tangent functions.
Finally, we have the contact page. Here, you can message me personally about things to add, remove, change, whatever! With a safe and open-source email system, I guarantee that I'll read your message and reply as soon as I can.
